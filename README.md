<p align="center"><strong>Emacs emulation for Visual Studio Code</strong></p>

This was a fork of I don't remember the original extension name but almost ALL the Emacs extensions brag to be Emacs-Friendly when all fails to implement such basic Emacs behaviors.
I had to fork and fix the little issues.
To give you an example, in Emacs when you use `Ctrl+Space` to enter selection mode and then select some text and press `DEL` key the text is removed and the selection mode is exited.
All the forks of forks don't implement this and when you select some text and `DEL` the text is erased but the selection mode is still operating, which is annoying for a real Emacs user, I fixed it and proposed a PR in one of the extension repository but they didn't even accept and instead ignored my answers when they asked my motivation.
Coding should be free and share, not about maintaining some domains like a master seeking for some stars and then denying the whole purpose of the product you hold..

In this version I also added a minibuffer feature. Press `alt+shift+1` to open it.
In the original Emacs this keybinding is to run a shell command in the mini buffer.


Now if you like it, Please ENjoy and if you want to improve the extension You're free to fork, modify and make a Push Request for the sake of perfection.

Emacs FTW.
