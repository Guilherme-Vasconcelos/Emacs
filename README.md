This is a fork of https://github.com/VSCodeEmacs/Emacs/tree/8df69304a75d4a1a86894c6529331da406157333

I intend on adding some modifications that I personally like.

Planned:

- [ ] `C-x k`: Hydra (each `k` press closing another tab).
- [ ] `C-c <left / right>`: Change tabs (with hydra).
- [ ] Undo doesn't seem to work with `C-/`, only `C-x u`. I'll try to figure out why.

For modifications that have already been done, see [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/Guilherme-Vasconcelos/Emacs/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
