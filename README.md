<p align="center"><strong>Emacs emulation for Visual Studio Code</strong></p>

This was a fork of I don't remember the original extension but most of extensions I tried in the past were finicky with the selection and failed to emulate the depth of Emacs.

I also added a minibuffer feature. Press `alt+shift+1` to open it. In the original Emacs this keybinding is to run a shell command in the mini buffer.
